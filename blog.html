              “It’s not that we only use technology, we live technology.” These words were said by a very renowned American director Godfrey Reggio and
              everything he said can be relatable. Everyday from waking up with mobile’s alarms to going to sleep by listening my favorite songs on
              the internet I use technology.
              <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
              Not only for entertainment purposes but technology have changed the how we live, communicate and connect.
              It is just amazing to see how much the technology has evolved and is being advanced day by day rapidly. Today you by a new iPhone next
              month there is another with more advanced features and computing power than yours, its just keeps on going and gets better and better.
              Ultimately, technology has also bought changes in my lifestyle drastically. I am fully dependent upon the technology in daily basis.
              Getting started my day with a sweet alarm, I wake up and check updates on sports and news on my mobile phone. Then I attend my online
              classes via my laptop and spend my day doing my course works on it and play games on my free time. I mostly spend my time watching
              YouTube videos online and playing online games with my friends, so does everyone in my family. I eat my dinner and then scroll through
              Facebook and Instagram for hours and go to sleep by plugging earphones in my ear playing my favorite playlist on them. Simply spend my
              day without technology is impossible for me. <br> <br>
              <span id="dots" style="font-size: 2rem;"> So, how has is affected my life? <br></span>
              A computer can be a man’s best friend in other hand It can
              be its biggest nemesis as well. It depends on how you use them. In my context I can say it has affected me both parallelly. It has saved
              my time on doing simple tasks and also everything I am studying is related to it. Meanwhile I spend most for my time watching at my
              computer’s screen straining my eyes and running away from physical exercise. But mostly I have been benefited from technologies in
              overall. I can text a friend of mine instantly, watch movies, play games and songs, see a food recipe and cook it, learn and many more,
              also and I am tackling the negative sides too. I give my eyes rest after an hour of watching the screen, do some push-ups and jumps
              daily and so on. Let’s face it we need technology to survive. Imaging how people lived fifty years ago makes me feel uncomfortable. In
              large scale it has changed the cycle of this world, no doubt everyone is benefiting from this rapidly growing technology, but as nothing
              is perfect is has brought raised to cyber crimes like online bullying, hacking, lacking of privacy and selling of private data,
              distraction, addiction and also depression. But one can take precautions to avoid such problems. So, everything depends on how one
              peruses to take proper precautions and steps while using technologies to avoid negative impacts. Take full benefits of it and stay safe
              physically and digitally.</span></p>
